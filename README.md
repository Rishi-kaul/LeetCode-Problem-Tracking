# LeetCode Problem Tracking

This repository contains a Python script to create an Excel file for tracking LeetCode problems solved, including an automatic calculation for the repeat date. The "Repeat Date" column in the Excel sheet will be populated using a formula that sets it to 10 days after the problem was solved, formatted as "mm/dd/yyyy".

## Contents

- `LeetCode_Tracking_Clean.xlsx`: The output Excel file generated by the script.
- `script.py`: The Python script used to generate the Excel file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library
- XlsxWriter library

## Setup

1. **Install the required libraries**:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas xlsxwriter
    ```

2. **Run the script**:
    Execute the script to generate the `LeetCode_Tracking_Clean.xlsx` file.
    ```sh
    python script.py
    ```

## Script Explanation

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Import the pandas library**:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    ```

2. **Create a DataFrame with the required columns and a sample entry**:
    ```python
    data = {
        "Problem": ["Example Problem"],
        "Date Solved": ["2024-06-01"],
        "Repeat Date": [""],  # This will be calculated with a formula in Excel
        "Link": ["https://leetcode.com/problems/example-problem"]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    ```

3. **Define the path for the output Excel file**:
    ```python
    excel_path = "/LeetCode_Tracking_Clean.xlsx"
    ```

4. **Write the DataFrame to an Excel file and add the formula for "Repeat Date"**:
    ```python
    with pd.ExcelWriter(excel_path, engine='xlsxwriter') as writer:
        df.to_excel(writer, index=False, sheet_name='Sheet1')
        worksheet = writer.sheets['Sheet1']
        worksheet.write('C1', 'Repeat Date')
        worksheet.write_formula('C2', '=TEXT(B2 + 10, "mm/dd/yyyy")')
        worksheet.set_column('A:D', 30)  # Adjust column width for better readability
    ```

The formula in the "Repeat Date" column (`'=TEXT(B2 + 10, "mm/dd/yyyy")'`) sets the repeat date to 10 days after the date the problem was solved, formatted as "mm/dd/yyyy".

## Output

The script generates an Excel file named `LeetCode_Tracking_Clean.xlsx` with the following structure:

| Problem         | Date Solved | Repeat Date          | Link                                             |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Example Problem | 2024-06-01  | =TEXT(B2 + 10, "mm/dd/yyyy") | [https://leetcode.com/problems/example-problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/example-problem) |

## Notes

- The `Repeat Date` formula is hardcoded to add 10 days to the `Date Solved`. You can modify this value as needed.
- The script sets the column width to 30 for better readability.
